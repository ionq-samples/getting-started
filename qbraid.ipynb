    "[qBraid](https://github.com/qBraid/qBraid) is platform-agnostic quantum runtime framework. Distinguishing itself through a streamlined and highly-configurable approach to cross-platform integration, the qBraid-SDK does not assume a fixed target software framework. Instead, it allows providers to dynamically register any desired run input program type as the target, depending on their specific needs."
